People can leave tips so other drivers know where to turn or if they should choose another.

<p class="h11">Web Design</p>
<p class="p11">Here are some of my websites. My favourite websites are the one with full bleed image with text over it. I think it sends a strong message, because lot of people like powerful visual cocepts, and as a designer/developer, I have to make my first time users stay on the website, that is why I like to go with a beautiful image for the landing page.

<!-- <p class="p16">In this equation, Ai represents the total accessibility for zone i, Ej represents the total amount of employment in each destination zone j, and Tij represents the morning peak-hour travel time in minutes from zone i to zone j. Finally, the parameter ùëí‚àíùõΩ has the effect of determining how much travel impedance matters in weighting a zone‚Äôs accessibility contribution; larger values mean that even relatively short travel times will greatly devalue the accessibility benefit of neighboring destinations, while smaller values of  mean that accessibility scores will give greater weight to a wider swath of destinations.<br><br>
In terms of labor markets, relatively lower skill, spatially dispersed jobs ‚Äì like fast food worker ‚Äì would tend to have higher values (i.e. more friction of distance), while higher skill, scarcer jobs like cardiologist ‚Äì would tend to have lower values (i.e. lower friction of distance); this is because workers are less likely to commute long distances to relatively low paying, spatially ubiquitous jobs, but more likely to be willing to endure long commutes to much rarer and higher paying work. For the purposes of our analysis, which emphasizes access across multiple industrial sectors, we apply a common ùëí‚àíùõΩ value to represent the friction of distance between residents and jobs across the entire labor market.

<p class="p18">My main focus when creating a website when we talk about responsivness is to make it mobile first. Nowadays we are having more users on their phones than on their laptops, so having both options for the user is definetely a big plus, and a potential hook in getting more users.</p>
