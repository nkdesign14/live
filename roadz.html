RoadZ</h1>
</div>
<div class="fade-in7"> <p class="p1dv">RoadZ is a free community-driven GPS navigation kiosk that enables users to build and use live maps and provides turn-by-turn directions, user-submitted travel times, route details. People can leave tips so other drivers know where to turn or if they should choose another.

<p class="h11">How does RoadZ explore routes?</p>
<p class="p11">RoadZ differs from traditional GPS n–∞v—ñg–∞t—ñ–æn —ï–æftw–∞r–µ —ñn th–∞t —ñt‚Äôs —Å–æmmun—ñt—É-dr—ñv–µn, g–∞th–µr—ñng —Å–æm—Äl–µm–µnt–∞r—É map data and traffic —ñnf–ærm–∞t—ñ–æn from —ñt—ï u—ï–µr—ï. To provide the shortest route, Waze needs to have accurate data for all nearby roads and routes. It gathers data whenever the app is running. While you‚Äôre driving, the app will compare data for all possible routes and offer you the most optimal route according to your preferences.
</p>
<p class="h12">Internet connection</p>
<p class="p12">RoadZ doesn‚Äôt work offline. Kiosk needs an internet connection to load routes. An internet connection is necessary for the kiosk by powering real-time traffic information and keeping the map up to date.
<br><br>Without an internet connection, kiosk is unable to get your location or navigate. The kiosk immediately analyzes information to ensure that others take the most optimal routes.
</p>

<div class="dash2"></div>

<p class="h13">GPS navigation</p>
<p class="p13">In addition to satellite data, which helps the kiosk determine the best route, a navigation kiosk like RoadZ can also gather data from its community of users.

<p class="p16">In this equation, Ai represents the total accessibility for zone i, Ej represents the total amount of employment in each destination zone j, and Tij represents the morning peak-hour travel time in minutes from zone i to zone j. Finally, the parameter ùëí‚àíùõΩ has the effect of determining how much travel impedance matters in weighting a zone‚Äôs accessibility contribution; larger values mean that even relatively short travel times will greatly devalue the accessibility benefit of neighboring destinations, while smaller values of  mean that accessibility scores will give greater weight to a wider swath of destinations.<br><br>
In terms of labor markets, relatively lower skill, spatially dispersed jobs ‚Äì like fast food worker ‚Äì would tend to have higher values (i.e. more friction of distance), while higher skill, scarcer jobs like cardiologist ‚Äì would tend to have lower values (i.e. lower friction of distance); this is because workers are less likely to commute long distances to relatively low paying, spatially ubiquitous jobs, but more likely to be willing to endure long commutes to much rarer and higher paying work. For the purposes of our analysis, which emphasizes access across multiple industrial sectors, we apply a common ùëí‚àíùõΩ value to represent the friction of distance between residents and jobs across the entire labor market.

<p class="h15">Target audience</p>
<p class="p18">My aim will be the people of San Francisco whom commute, and especially drive to work. This kiosk will help them to find what is the fastest way for them to get to work, or designated location.</p>

<p class="h16">Difference</p>
<p class="p19">The main difference between all the other apps, like Ways, Google Maps...etc. This kiosk will be able to calculate how many people are going in the same direction, using the same streets, and balance the load management, so that everyone whom uses it can get at even time. Most importantly not just be stuck in traffic.

<p class="p22">I believe that evry project is unique in its own way. When I have got to the wireframing stage in this projects, I have not find it useful. It was time consuming at the time, so I was more focused on the high-fidelity design.
